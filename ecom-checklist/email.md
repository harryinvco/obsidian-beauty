Hey [First Name],

Thanks for grabbing the eCom Growth Leak Checklist â€” here is the link (https://obsidianco.notion.site/The-Obsidian-eCom-Growth-Leak-Checklist-284035fa86b480e5b7a3c871bae7d249?source=copy_link)

This is the exact 23-point audit we use with our clients to fix revenue leaks in their paid ads, landing pages, and retention flows.

ðŸ§  Pro Tip: Most stores are bleeding money in 2â€“3 key areas â€” usually in the first 10 questions. Run through the checklist now (takes 10â€“15 mins) and score yourself honestly.

Once youâ€™ve done that, youâ€™ve got 2 solid options:

Fix it yourself (the checklist shows you where to start)

Or if you'd rather save time â†’ book a free 15-min Leak Fix Call (https://calendly.com/mnikolaou-toc/lets-talk-15min)
 and Iâ€™ll walk you through exactly what to fix first.

No pitch. Just clarity.

Let me know if you hit any snags â€” happy to help.

Talk soon,
â€”Mike
COO, The Obsidian Co.â„¢
