# Deployment Checklist ✅

## Git Deployment
✅ **Code Pushed**: All changes committed and pushed to GitHub (commit: d9d507b)
✅ **Dependencies Installed**: Netlify functions dependencies installed

## Netlify Configuration Required

### 1. Build Settings
Make sure your Netlify site has these build settings:
- **Build command**: (leave empty or `npm install` if needed)
- **Publish directory**: `.` (root)
- **Functions directory**: `netlify/functions`

### 2. Environment Variables
In your Netlify site dashboard, go to Site Settings > Environment Variables and set:

```
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key  
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key (optional)
```

### 3. Database Setup
Run the SQL commands in `supabase-setup.sql` in your Supabase SQL editor to create the required tables:
- `beauty_leads` (active)
- `saas_leads` (ready, disabled)
- `ecom_leads` (ready, disabled)

## Expected Results After Deployment

### ✅ Working Pages:
- `offers.theobsidianco.com/` → Hub page (main landing)
- `offers.theobsidianco.com/beauty` → Beauty Ad Vault (ACTIVE, captures leads)
- `offers.theobsidianco.com/saas` → SaaS page (shows "under development")
- `offers.theobsidianco.com/ecom-checklist` → Ecom page (shows "under development")

### ❌ Blocked Pages:
- `offers.theobsidianco.com/digital-products` → 404 (hidden in production)

### 🔧 Functions:
- `/.netlify/functions/submit` → Beauty leads (active)
- `/.netlify/functions/submit-saas` → SaaS leads (disabled)
- `/.netlify/functions/submit-ecom` → Ecom leads (disabled)

## Testing Checklist

After deployment, test:

1. **Hub Page**: Loads correctly at root URL
2. **Beauty Page**: 
   - Form submission works
   - Redirects to thank-you page
   - Leads saved to `beauty_leads` table
3. **SaaS/Ecom Pages**: 
   - Forms show success message but don't save data
   - No errors in browser console
4. **Digital Products**: Returns 404 in production

## Next Steps

🚀 **Beauty page is ready for traffic!**

When ready to activate SaaS or Ecom pages:
1. Edit the respective function file
2. Remove the "TEMPORARILY DISABLED" section  
3. Uncomment the database insertion code
4. Deploy and test
